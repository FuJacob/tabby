# Cotabby Source Layout

This document is the canonical placement map for production and test source files. It complements
`ARCHITECTURE.md`, which explains runtime ownership and data flow.

Swift folders do not create namespaces. Every Swift file discovered under `Cotabby/` still compiles
into the application module, and every file under `CotabbyTests/` compiles into the test module.
Folders exist so a maintainer can predict where a responsibility lives before searching.

## Placement Rules

1. Choose the top-level architectural boundary first: `App`, `UI`, `Services`, `Models`, or
   `Support`.
2. Choose the product subsystem next, such as `Suggestion`, `Focus`, `Runtime`, or `Settings`.
3. Keep a small cohesive subsystem flat.
4. Add a child folder only when at least two files form a stable responsibility with a predictable
   name. Do not create one-file folders merely to shorten a file list.
5. Put a direct unit test under the corresponding `CotabbyTests/` responsibility. Cross-cutting
   coordinator tests may remain grouped by the coordinator they exercise.
6. Folder moves must not change Swift access control, runtime ownership, or target membership.
   XcodeGen discovers the new paths; regenerate `Cotabby.xcodeproj` after moving files.

Files left directly inside a subsystem are intentionally its root owners or a small cohesive set.
For example, `SuggestionEngineRouter.swift` remains at `Services/Runtime/` because it coordinates all
three backend folders, while `FocusTracker.swift` remains at `Services/Focus/` because it owns the
whole focus lifecycle rather than one resolution or caching technique.

## Test Tree

`CotabbyTests/` mirrors the production responsibility after removing the leading `Cotabby/`. For
example:

~~~text
Cotabby/Support/Suggestion/Output/SuggestionTextNormalizer.swift
CotabbyTests/Support/Suggestion/Output/SuggestionTextNormalizerTests.swift

Cotabby/Services/Runtime/Llama/LlamaSuggestionEngine.swift
CotabbyTests/Services/Runtime/Llama/LlamaSuggestionEngineStreamingTests.swift

Cotabby/App/Coordinators/Suggestion/SuggestionCoordinator.swift
CotabbyTests/App/Coordinators/Suggestion/SuggestionCoordinatorPredictionTests.swift
~~~

Tests that exercise several production values may stay at the nearest shared subsystem root. Evals
remain under `CotabbyTests/Evals`, and shared fixtures remain under `CotabbyTests/TestSupport`.

## Adding Or Moving A File

1. Identify its single dominant responsibility using the map above.
2. Place or move its direct tests with it conceptually.
3. Update tracked Markdown links and any scripts containing physical paths.
4. Run `xcodegen generate` and commit the regenerated project.
5. Run SwiftLint, a build, and `build-for-testing` before opening a pull request.

When a file seems to fit several folders, that usually signals either a cross-subsystem contract
that belongs in `Models`, a root orchestrator that should remain above its collaborators, or a type
that owns too many responsibilities and should be split by behavior rather than hidden by nesting.
