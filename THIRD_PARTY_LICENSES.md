## SymSpell

The inline autocorrect feature uses a Swift port of SymSpell (Wolf Garbe's
Symmetric Delete spelling-correction algorithm). The port lives in
`Cotabby/Support/Spelling/SymSpell.swift`. SymSpell is distributed under the MIT License:

## Frequency dictionaries

`Cotabby/Resources/frequency_dictionary_en_82_765.txt` is the English frequency
dictionary that ships with SymSpell. Per SymSpell, it is derived from two sources.

### Google Books Ngram data (CC BY 3.0)

The word frequencies are derived from the Google Books Ngram dataset, released under
the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license (CC BY 3.0). The data is used
in derived form (word/frequency pairs).

- Dataset: https://books.google.com/ngrams
- License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/

### SCOWL (Spell Checker Oriented Word Lists)

The word list is derived from SCOWL by Kevin Atkinson:

```
Copyright 2000-2026 by Kevin Atkinson

Permission to use, copy, modify, distribute, and sell any part of the English
Speller Database (ESDB, previously known as SCOWLv2), or word lists
created from it, is hereby granted without fee, provided that the above
copyright notice appears in all copies and that both the above copyright
notice and this notice appear in supporting documentation. Kevin Atkinson
makes no representations about the suitability of this database for any
purpose. It is provided "as is" without express or implied warranty.
```

SCOWL itself incorporates material from several sources (12dicts by Alan Beale,
ENABLE2K, the UK Advanced Cryptics Dictionary by J Ross Beresford, WordNet by
Princeton University, and others). Their individual copyright notices are in the
full SCOWL copyright file.

### Multilingual dictionaries

Cotabby also bundles the German, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Italian, and Russian
frequency dictionaries published in SymSpell's `SymSpell.FrequencyDictionary`
folder at commit `b8b2905bde` (March 13, 2020). SymSpell generated these by
intersecting Google Books Ngram frequencies with Hunspell word lists.

The exact source notices, applicable full license texts, upstream commits, and
file checksums are bundled with the app under:

`Cotabby/Resources/SpellingDictionaries/NOTICE.md`

The corresponding source word-list notices were captured from
`wooorm/dictionaries` commit
`5ede45bb705d3f9f525ea779f7b487f9fc062013`, the latest revision before
SymSpell published the derived multilingual files.

Chinese is intentionally not bundled: SymSpell's generation notes do not identify
the source word list and license for that file, and Cotabby's current typo gate does
not yet provide reliable word segmentation for languages without whitespace.
