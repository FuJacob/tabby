# Cotabby FAQ

Frequently asked questions about Cotabby, the free, open-source, local-first AI
autocomplete for macOS.

## 1. What is Cotabby and how does it work?

Cotabby is a free, open-source macOS menu bar app that adds AI autocomplete to
almost any text field on your Mac. As you type, it shows a gray "ghost text"
suggestion inline next to your cursor. Press `Tab` to accept it, or just keep
typing to ignore it.

Under the hood, Cotabby notices which text field you are focused on, reads what
you have typed (and optionally the surrounding on-screen context), generates a
short continuation with your selected engine, and inserts the text you accept right
where your cursor is.

Beyond sentence completion, Cotabby also includes:

- Inline emoji autocomplete (type `:smile` and accept).
- Slash macros for quick math, unit and currency conversion, dates, and more
  (type `/`).
- Autocorrect that fixes typos with a single keystroke.

Cotabby is currently in beta.

## 2. Is Cotabby free?

Yes. Cotabby is completely free and open source, released under the GNU Affero
General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0). There is no subscription, no account, and
no paid tier. You are free to read, modify, and redistribute the source under the
terms of that license. The code lives at
[github.com/FuJacob/cotabby](https://github.com/FuJacob/cotabby).

The downloadable AI models are free too, and Apple Intelligence is built into
macOS. If you configure a third-party OpenAI-compatible endpoint, that provider may charge for use.

## 3. Is my data private? Does Cotabby send what I type to the cloud?

Privacy is the core design principle. Cotabby's default engines produce suggestions
on your Mac:

- Apple Intelligence and the Open Source engine run on-device.
- The optional OpenAI-compatible engine sends the bounded request to the endpoint
  you configure. That endpoint can be loopback, on your LAN, or a public HTTPS service.
- When screen context is used, the screenshot is captured and read entirely
  on-device with Apple's built-in text recognition. No images or recognized text
  are ever uploaded.
- Cotabby contains no analytics, no telemetry, and no crash reporting.

Apart from a configured endpoint, Cotabby uses the network to download or search
for models and to check for app updates. Those operations do not carry the text
you type, your suggestions, or anything from your screen.

For the technically curious: a normal install never writes your typed text to
disk. Only special developer debug builds write local diagnostic logs, and even
those stay on your Mac and are never transmitted.

## 4. What are the system requirements?

- macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later.
- Apple Silicon (M-series) is strongly recommended for good local-model
  performance.
- Free disk space for any local models you download (from under 1 GB to around
  5 GB each, depending on the model you pick).
- To use the Apple Intelligence engine specifically, you need macOS 26 or later
  on a Mac that supports Apple Intelligence, with Apple Intelligence turned on in
  System Settings. On older Macs, use the Open Source engine or a configured endpoint instead.

## 5. How do I install Cotabby?

There are three ways:

- **Homebrew (recommended):**
  ```sh
  brew tap FuJacob/cotabby
  brew install --cask cotabby
  ```
  Update later with `brew upgrade --cask cotabby`.
- **Direct download:** get the latest release from
  [cotabby.app](https://cotabby.app) (or the GitHub Releases page) and drag
  Cotabby into your Applications folder.
- **Build from source:** clone
  [github.com/FuJacob/cotabby](https://github.com/FuJacob/cotabby) and open the
  project in Xcode.

After launching, Cotabby lives in your menu bar and walks you through a short
setup. It checks for and installs updates automatically when new versions ship.

## 6. Why does Cotabby need Accessibility, Input Monitoring, and Screen Recording permissions?

Cotabby works inside other apps, so macOS asks for permissions that map to specific features:

- **Accessibility:** to read the text and cursor position in the field you are
  typing in, and to insert the text you accept.
- **Input Monitoring:** to notice your typing so it knows when to suggest, and to
  recognize the accept key (`Tab`).
- **Screen Recording (optional):** to capture the area around your cursor for visual
  context. Text-only autocomplete still works without it.

Cotabby guides you through granting each one during setup and shows a reminder if
a permission is later turned off. You can change them anytime in System Settings
under Privacy & Security. Cotabby blocks generation, presentation, and insertion in password and
other secure fields.

## 7. How do I use Cotabby, and how do I accept or dismiss a suggestion?

Start typing in any supported text field. When a suggestion appears as ghost
text:

- Press `Tab` to accept it. By default `Tab` accepts one word (or a full phrase,
  depending on your Acceptance Mode setting).
- Press the accept-entire-suggestion key (backtick `` ` `` by default) to take
  the whole suggestion at once.
- Keep typing to ignore the suggestion, or press `Esc` to dismiss it.

All of these keys are rebindable in Settings, under Shortcuts, so you can pick
whatever feels natural.

## 8. Which apps does Cotabby work in?

Cotabby works system-wide in almost any standard, editable text field, including
native Mac apps and most web and Electron apps (such as Chrome).

For your safety and privacy, it deliberately stays out of:

- Password and other secure or sensitive fields (passcodes, card numbers,
  one-time codes, and the like).
- Terminal apps (Terminal, iTerm2, and others).

Some browser and Electron editors expose their contents to macOS a little
differently, so Cotabby includes special handling for them. If a particular
field does not expose what Cotabby needs, it simply stays quiet there.

## 9. Which AI model does Cotabby use, and does it work offline?

Cotabby gives you three engines, and you choose which one to use:

- **Apple Intelligence:** Apple's on-device model built into macOS (requires
  macOS 26 or later on a supported Mac). Nothing to download.
- **Open Source:** a local model that runs directly on your Mac. You can pick
  from several tiers, from a lightweight model (under 1 GB) up to a larger,
  higher-quality one (around 5 GB). Larger models write better but run slower.
  You can also import your own GGUF model or browse Hugging Face from inside the
  app.
- **OpenAI-compatible:** a completion or chat endpoint you configure, including
  local Ollama, another LAN host, or a public HTTPS service.

Apple Intelligence and Open Source run entirely on your Mac and work offline once configured.
The endpoint engine's network requirements depend on the server you choose.

## 10. How do I customize Cotabby or turn it off?

Open Settings from the menu bar icon. A few of the things you can adjust:

- Suggestion length, multi-line suggestions, and Fast Mode (which skips screen
  context for faster results).
- Ghost text color and opacity, and whether suggestions appear inline or as a
  popup.
- Engine and model selection, emoji style, slash macros, and your keyboard
  shortcuts.

To pause Cotabby:

- Turn off "Enable Globally" in the menu or General settings to disable it
  everywhere without quitting.
- Add specific apps to the Disabled Apps list (or toggle it off for the app you
  are currently in) to silence it just there.
- Set a global toggle shortcut in Settings, under Shortcuts, to flip it on and
  off from the keyboard.

To quit entirely, choose Quit from the menu bar.
