/// File overview:
/// Encapsulates the CFNetwork temp-file rescue that `ModelDownloadSessionDelegate`
/// needs to perform inside `urlSession(_:downloadTask:didFinishDownloadingTo:)`.
/// The logic is extracted from the delegate so the race-sensitive part is
/// covered by unit tests instead of only by real downloads.
///
/// Why this is its own type:
/// URLSession's `URLSessionDownloadTask` is painful to construct in a unit
/// test without mocking the whole networking stack. Separating the file-move
/// decision from the delegate callback means the decision can be tested
/// with just a real `FileManager` and a pair of real file URLs.

    /// Why this must be synchronous:
    /// URLSession's contract for `didFinishDownloadingTo` is that `location`
    /// is valid only for the duration of that one callback. CFNetwork reclaims
    /// the file the moment the callback returns. Any `DispatchQueue.async`,
    /// `Task {}`, or continuation hop between receiving `location` and moving
    /// it would race against CFNetwork's cleanup — which is exactly the bug
    /// this rescue pathway was introduced to fix (see PR #31 / issue #30).
