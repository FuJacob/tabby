/// File overview:
/// Adapts Apple's on-device Foundation Models framework to Cotabby's existing
/// `SuggestionGenerating` capability. The coordinator should not care whether suggestions come
/// from llama.cpp or Apple Intelligence; that backend choice belongs in app composition.
///
/// The engine caches a pristine `LanguageModelSession` so the focus-time `prewarm(for:)` call can
/// hand the same prewarmed session to the first user-typed request. Reuse is bounded: once a
/// session has actually serviced a `respond` (its transcript has grown past the pristine count)
/// or is mid-stream (`isResponding == true`), the next request builds a fresh session instead.
/// This keeps the prewarm latency win on the first keystroke after focus without inheriting
/// Apple's two single-flight failure modes — `concurrentRequests` from overlapping streams on the
/// same session, and `exceededContextWindowSize` from transcript entries piling up over many
/// keystrokes in the same field. See `ensureSession` for the reuse predicate.
///
/// `prewarm(for:)` is the supported hook for "the user just focused an editable field; a real
/// request is likely within a second." The coordinator calls it from the focus path; the engine
/// builds (or reuses) the session and calls Apple's `LanguageModelSession.prewarm()` so weight
/// loading and instruction tokenization happen before the first user-visible respond call.
///
/// Generation itself goes through `session.streamResponse` rather than `session.respond`. Apple's
/// stream yields cumulative partials, so the loop captures the latest snapshot and exits with it
/// as the final raw text. The win is responsiveness to cancellation: `Task.checkCancellation()`
/// inside the loop lets the coordinator interrupt mid-decode when the user types past the
/// in-flight suggestion, where `respond` would otherwise have to run to completion. The external
/// `SuggestionResult` shape is unchanged, so the rest of the pipeline (overlay, presenter,
/// active-session reconciliation) stays as-is — pushing partials all the way to the overlay is a
/// separate, larger change scoped to a follow-up.
