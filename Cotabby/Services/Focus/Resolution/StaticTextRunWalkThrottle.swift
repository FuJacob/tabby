/// Throttles the Branch 2.5 static-text-run walk so it runs at most once per `interval` while
/// focus stays on one field. `collectStaticTextRuns` visits up to ~300 AX nodes with several
/// synchronous IPC round trips per static-text leaf; in Gmail-class Chromium editors it is the
/// primary caret path and previously re-walked on every poll tick and every keystroke.
///
/// Within the window the cached run frames are reused and only the cheap, pure caret-placement
/// math reruns against the live text and selection, so the caret keeps tracking the typed offset;
/// the frames themselves can trail a reflow by up to one interval, the same accepted tradeoff as
/// `DeepGeometryWalkThrottle`. Keyed on `focusChangeSequence` rather than the AX element because
/// Chrome recycles node handles, which would defeat an identity key (see the deep-walk throttle's
/// rationale); callers additionally restrict the throttle to the focused element so one slot can
/// never serve runs collected from a different root.
