/// settings plus a recommended model, so a new user can pick one card instead of reasoning about
/// engines, model sizes, and completion length on their own.
///
/// The template only declares *intent* (which tier, which length, which behavior flags). The
/// concrete engine and downloadable model are resolved by `OnboardingTemplateRecommender` because
/// that decision depends on runtime facts (Apple Intelligence availability, installed RAM) that a
/// static value type should not capture. Keeping the data here and the rules in `Support/` keeps the
/// resolution pure and unit-testable.

/// One of the onboarding starting points. Quick, Everyday, and Powerful are the curated tiers shown
/// as selectable cards (`curatedTiers`). Custom is the neutral "set it up yourself" option that
/// applies lean defaults; it is no longer its own card. The template step's "Set up later" button
/// applies it under the hood so a user who does not want a curated tier can still move forward and
/// configure the rest in Settings.
