/// Defines Cotabby's custom autocomplete "rules" — short imperative style directives the user can
/// add as tags. A rule is one clause of the same shape as the prompt's built-in rules (e.g.
/// "Never use em dashes"), so the renderers can emit each as a single bullet.
///
/// `defaultRules` is the baseline the editor's "Clear" action restores (currently empty — rules are
/// opt-in). `suggestedPalette` is the
/// broader set surfaced as tappable chips so users are never staring at a blank box. `normalize`
/// is the single chokepoint that keeps stored rules bounded and de-duplicated regardless of whether
/// they came from onboarding, settings, the palette, or a future import path.

    /// measures adherence, so surfacing the feature is a net-negative promise right now. Hiding is
    /// fully reversible: stored rules in `cotabbyCustomRules` are never deleted, the editor and
    /// renderer code is kept, so flipping this back to `true` restores the feature once rules are
