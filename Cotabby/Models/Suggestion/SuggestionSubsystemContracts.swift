/// permission reads, focus snapshots, input events, suggestion generation, text insertion, and

/// This is a high-leverage maintainability move because `SuggestionCoordinator` is the app's
/// largest orchestration type. Depending on contracts instead of concrete classes makes the data
/// flow easier to understand today and gives a natural seam for tests later without changing
