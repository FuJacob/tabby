/// File overview:
/// Suppresses transient `Supported → Blocked → Supported` capability flicker on the *same* focused
/// element so the suggestion overlay does not tear down and rebuild every time a host app momentarily
/// republishes its focused field.
///
/// Background. `FocusCapabilityResolver` re-derives capability from live AX attributes on every poll
/// with no temporal smoothing. Some Catalyst-style fields (Apple Calendar's event editor is the
/// reproduction) briefly drop one of `textValue` / `selectionRange` / `caretBounds` while they
/// redraw, which collapses capability to Blocked for a single poll and bounces back to Supported on
/// the next. Without this gate every flicker drives `handleFocusSnapshotChange` to call
/// `disablePredictionsPreservingVisualContext` → `OverlayController.hide` → `panel.orderOut(nil)`,
/// which the user sees as the overlay opening and closing several times per second.
///
/// The gate is intentionally tiny and pure: it tracks the most recently delivered Supported element
/// identity and a consecutive-Blocked counter, and tells the caller whether to apply the new
/// snapshot or keep treating the field as Supported for now. A persistent loss of capability (the
/// real "field went away" case) clears the gate after `requiredConsecutiveBlockedReads` so the
/// downgrade still propagates promptly — at the observed ~80–150 ms poll cadence that is roughly
/// 160–300 ms of suppression, well above the ~13 ms flicker pairs seen in the logs but short enough
/// that genuine focus loss is not perceptible.
