/// every log line touched by that request — coordinator state transitions, router selection, engine
/// generation, LLM I/O capture, insertion — stamps the same ID into its metadata under
/// `request_id`. That lets an AI debugger pull "everything that happened for one suggestion" with
/// one `jq` filter, instead of guessing at timing windows.

/// from a log line, long enough to make collisions inside a session essentially impossible.
