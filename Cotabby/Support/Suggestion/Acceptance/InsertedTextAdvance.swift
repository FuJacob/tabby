/// The accept-time overlay slide and the predicted-caret fallback both need the caret's true
/// travel, not the ghost render font's width of the same text. The ghost is deliberately floored
/// at 14pt for legibility while hosts commonly render smaller (TextEdit's Helvetica 12, plain-text
/// Menlo 11), so a ghost-font measurement overshoots the real caret advance by 5-11pt per accepted
/// word. That error lands in the overlay's anchor bookkeeping, accumulates past the stability
/// gate's drift tolerance, and surfaces as a sideways nudge tens of milliseconds after the accept,
/// when no input is happening and any motion reads as jitter. Measuring with the field's own font
/// keeps the anchor aligned with where AX will report the caret once the host publishes the
/// insert, so post-accept reconciles have nothing to correct.
