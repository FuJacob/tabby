/// File overview:
/// Pure decision for whether a reconcile tick should reposition the visible ghost-text overlay.
///
/// Why this file exists:
/// `SuggestionCoordinator` reconciles the active suggestion many times: on every focus poll, on
/// every settings publication, and on the +30ms post-insertion refresh that fires after each Tab
/// accept. The post-insertion path is the one that visibly hurts: AX commonly returns a slightly
/// drifted `caretRect` / `observedCharWidth` after a synthesized insertion, and re-rendering
/// against those drifted measurements is what causes the visible one-frame "shift left and down
/// then snap back" the user sees on accept. The gate below holds the existing geometry whenever
/// the field, text, and on-screen field bounds have not materially moved; legitimate context
/// changes (field switch, window drag, text change) still re-anchor. Keeping the rule outside the
/// coordinator means it can be unit-tested in isolation from any AppKit state.

    /// of the same field, while still catching whole-pixel movements from a real window drag.

    /// are held so the slightly different caret AX returns for the same position after a synthesized
    /// insertion, plus the sub-pixel residual of an exact-width advance, do not jitter the ghost.
    /// Because the fresh caret is compared against the held (advanced) caret, this also bounds
    /// cumulative advance drift to roughly this distance before a correction fires.
    ///
    /// 6pt is chosen to sit above typical post-insertion AX caret noise (~0.5-1pt) and the per-accept
    /// kerning residual, yet below a single character's advance in common body fonts (~7-10pt at 14pt),

    ///   - The overlay is currently hidden (this is a fresh show).
    ///   - The focus session changed (different field, or the same field after focus toggled).
    ///   - The displayed text changed (user partially accepted, or typed-through advanced the tail).
    ///   - The caret moved beyond `caretDriftTolerance` from where the overlay is currently anchored
    ///     (a genuine caret move, or accumulated advance drift that needs correcting).
    ///   - The host editor's frame moved on screen (window drag, sheet appear, etc.).

    /// synthesized insert and the host publishing it back through AX, the snapshot's caret is the
    /// PRE-insertion one, a full accepted-word-width left of where the overlay correctly sits. The
    /// drift tolerance cannot tell that stale rect from a genuine caret move, so the +30ms
    /// post-insertion refresh used to re-anchor the ghost onto the just-accepted word and the next
    /// poll tick snapped it back: the left-then-right accept jitter. While the field and text are
    /// unchanged, stale geometry is never worth re-anchoring to; the hold lasts at most one or two
    /// poll ticks because the sentinel clears the moment AX catches up.
    /// How long after an acceptance a backward (against the writing direction) caret jump with
    /// unchanged text is treated as stale geometry rather than a real move. Child-run hosts
    /// publish the inserted VALUE tens of milliseconds before their run frames reflow, and the
    /// run-walk throttle can stretch that to ~100ms more; measured stale-then-fresh re-anchor
    /// pairs land 8-100ms after the accept. 300ms covers that with margin while keeping the

    /// unchanged text right after an accept cannot be a real move: real backward moves change the
    /// preceding text and tear the session down through the reconciler instead of reaching this
    /// gate. What does reach it is stale geometry: child-run hosts publish the inserted value
    /// before their run frames reflow, so the post-publish caret maps into pre-insert frames and
    /// lands a word left of the overlay; re-anchoring there and snapping back on the fresh walk
