///   1. `shouldSearchDeep` — whether the focused input's own caret geometry is too weak to trust,

///   2. `select` — given the primary candidate's geometry and an optional deep-walk result, which
///      rect to actually ship, following a fixed precedence.
///
/// The regression these protect against is trusting a descendant rect over the focused input's own
/// usable rect (or vice versa). Chrome's AXTextArea answers BoundsForRange with a multi-line union
/// rect — labelled `.derived` but unusable for precise caret placement — while the leaf AXStaticText
/// holding the active line carries a real `.exact` rect that the deep walk can recover.
