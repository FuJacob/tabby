/// File overview:
/// Self-contained Swift implementation of SymSpell (Wolf Garbe's Symmetric Delete spelling
/// correction, https://github.com/wolfgarbe/symspell). Given a frequency dictionary of correct
/// words it returns the most frequent word within a small edit distance of a query in roughly
/// constant time, by precomputing a "delete index": every dictionary word is reduced by up to
/// `maxDictionaryEditDistance` single-character deletions, and a query is matched by reducing it the
/// same way and intersecting. Two strings are within edit distance k iff one of their delete-sets
/// intersects, which is what makes lookup independent of dictionary size.
///
/// We use this as the *correction* source for inline autocorrect. Detection (is-this-a-typo) stays
/// with `NSSpellChecker` so proper nouns and the user's learned words are respected and a fixed
/// dictionary never mis-"corrects" a real name.
///
/// Ported in-repo (rather than added as a dependency) so it is reviewable and unit-tested. The
/// delete index is memory-heavy but small next to the app's llama runtime, and is built once off
/// the main thread (see `SymSpellCorrector`).
